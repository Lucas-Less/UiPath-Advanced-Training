Calculate Security Hash and Generate Early Report


Hi guys!

For this Robots work as it should, you need to do some changes on the workflows.
Make sure to adapt the information on the config excel with your Orchestrator to make sure they work properly,
After setting the orchestrator asset name, and redefine some selectors adapting to your envirolment it will work correctly.

Wish you the Best.
